You can send information from Bash to Ray via one of these third party packages:

## node-ray-cli

Install the package normally with `npm`:

```bash
npm install node-ray-cli
```

...install it globally to be able to access it from any script/directory:

```bash
npm install -g node-ray-cli
```

...or run it without installing using `npx`:

```bash
npx node-ray-cli --help
```
